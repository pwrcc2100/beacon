# Beacon Wellbeing Survey
## Product Overview for Clients

---

### **What is Beacon?**

Beacon is a validated psychosocial pulse survey designed for early detection of workplace wellbeing risks. It measures the key predictors of work stress, psychological safety, and organisational health through a quick, confidential check-in.

**This is about your systems and culture, not individual mental health assessments.**

---

### **The 5 Core Questions** (2 minutes to complete)

Each question uses a 3-point scale for quick, honest responses:

| # | Dimension | Question | Purpose |
|---|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Sentiment / Overall** | "How are you feeling about work this week?" | Captures overall wellbeing and mood |
| 2 | **Workload / Capacity** | "How's your workload?" | Identifies unsustainable job demands |
| 3 | **Psychological Safety** | "Do you feel safe speaking up?" | Measures trust and voice in the organisation |
| 4 | **Leadership Support** | "Do you feel supported by leadership?" | Assesses management responsiveness |
| 5 | **Clarity / Direction** | "Are you clear on what's expected?" | Evaluates role clarity and expectations |

**Response Options:**
- ‚úÖ Positive (e.g., "Good ‚Äì I'm doing well")
- üòê Neutral (e.g., "Okay ‚Äì Getting by")
- ‚ùå Negative (e.g., "Not great ‚Äì I'm struggling")
