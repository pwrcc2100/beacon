## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do surveys take?
**60 seconds.** We've designed Beacon to be quick and non-intrusive. Employees answer 5 simple questions and can complete it during a coffee break.

### How often are surveys sent?
**Weekly by default**, but frequency is customizable. Some clients prefer fortnightly or monthly. We recommend weekly for early detection.

### What if response rates are low?
We provide best-practice guidance on communication and timing. Typical response rates are 70-85% when surveys are well-communicated and leadership is engaged.

### Can we add custom questions?
**Yes**, custom questions are available as an add-on. We recommend starting with the core 5 questions to establish baseline data.

### How is this different from engagement surveys?
Traditional engagement surveys are retrospective and infrequent (annual). Beacon is **proactive and continuous**, designed for early detection of psychosocial risks, not just measuring satisfaction.

### What happens if a team scores poorly?
The dashboard highlights at-risk teams automatically. We provide intervention guides and can connect you with workplace psychologists if needed.

### Can we integrate with our HRIS?
**Yes**, Enterprise plans include API access for automatic employee data sync with platforms like BambooHR, Workday, and SAP SuccessFactors.

### Is there a minimum contract term?
**No lock-in contracts**. We offer month-to-month plans. Most clients see value within the first 3 months and continue long-term.

### How do you ensure anonymity?
Survey responses contain no identifying informationâ€”only the aggregated team/department they belong to. Single-use tokens prevent linking responses to individuals.

### Can managers see individual responses?
**No.** Managers only see aggregated data for their team (minimum 5 responses). This ensures psychological safety for honest feedback.
