# Beacon Support Path Workflow
## End-to-End Support System for High-Risk Responses

---

## **Overview**

The Beacon Support Path is an intelligent, automated workflow that activates when survey responses indicate someone may be struggling. It provides immediate resources while offering optional connection to organisational support systems.

**Key Principle:** Support is offered, never forced. Employees maintain full control.

---

## **Trigger: When Support Path Activates**

The system automatically detects high-risk indicators across the 5 core questions:

| Question | High-Risk Response | Triggers Support? |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Sentiment** | "Not great – I'm struggling" | ✅ Yes |
| **Workload** | "Unsustainable" | ✅ Yes |
| **Safety** | "Don't feel safe raising issues" | ✅ Yes |
| **Support** | "Not supported" | ✅ Yes |
| **Clarity** | "Unclear about priorities" | ⚠️ May trigger (configurable) |

**Any single high-risk response activates the Support Path.**

---

## **Complete Workflow Stages**

### **Stage 1: Support Request Screen**

**When:** Immediately after answering all 5 questions, if high-risk detected

**Appears:** Orange-coloured prompt with three clear options

**Text:**
> "Thank you for sharing.  
> Would you like someone to reach out to offer support?"

**Options:**
- ✅ **Yes, I'd like to be contacted** → Proceeds to Support Options
- ℹ️ **Tell me more about available support** → Shows available contacts, then repeats question
- ❌ **No thanks, I'm managing** → Skips to Crisis Resources

**Privacy Message:** *"Your individual responses remain confidential. We only see aggregated data."*

**[Finish Survey]** button → Submits and completes

---

### **Stage 4: Database & Notifications**

#### **What Gets Stored**
All support requests are logged in the `support_requests` table:
- Employee ID (if known) or anonymous
- Selected contacts (array)
- Preferred contact method
- Preferred timeframe
- Status: `pending` → `assigned` → `contacted` → `resolved`

#### **Automatic Notifications**
When a support request is submitted:
1. **Dashboard Alert** - HR/WHS sees pending request immediately
2. **Email to Selected Contacts** - Anonymised request details with preferred contact method
3. **Tracking** - Full audit trail for compliance

#### **For High-Risk Without Support Request**
If employee selects "No thanks, I'm managing":
- Aggregate alert still generated: *"3 employees flagged high-risk this week, no support requested"*
- Allows proactive organisational response
- Individual responses remain confidential
