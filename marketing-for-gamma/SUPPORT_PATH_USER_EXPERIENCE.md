## The Journey: From Survey to Support

### **Screen 1: Survey Completion** 📝
*After answering all 5 questions*

Employee completes the wellbeing survey by selecting from:
- ✅ Green: "Good" / "Manageable" / "Comfortable" / "Supported" / "Clear"
- 😐 Yellow: "Okay" / "Busy but okay" / "Sometimes hesitate" / "Somewhat" / "Mostly"
- ❌ Red: "Struggling" / "Unsustainable" / "Don't feel safe" / "Not supported" / "Unclear"

**What happens:** System automatically detects any ❌ (red) responses as high-risk indicators.

---

### **Screen 2: Support Offer Appears** 🛡️
*Automatically shown when high-risk detected*

**What employee sees:**
Orange banner appears with message:
> "Thank you for sharing. Would you like someone to reach out to offer support?"

**Three options:**
1. **✅ Yes, I'd like to be contacted**
   - Proceeds to detailed support options
   
2. **ℹ️ Tell me more about available support**
   - Shows: "Available support includes HR, WHS Leader, Manager, EAP, Union Representative, or Other contacts."
   - Then asks the question again
   
3. **❌ No thanks, I'm managing**
   - Skips to crisis resources (still shown for safety)

**Key feature:** Employee is in complete control. No pressure, no judgment.

---

### **Screen 3: Support Options** 🎯
*Only if they selected "Yes, I'd like to be contacted"*

**Three sections to complete:**

#### **WHO** should contact them?
Checkboxes (select all that apply):
- [ ] HR Team
- [ ] WHS Leader
- [ ] My Direct Manager
- [ ] Senior Leadership

#### **HOW** should they contact you?
Radio buttons (select one):

- ○ Request anonymous meeting *(HR arranges confidentially)*

#### **WHEN** would you like to hear from them?

**Continue button** → Moves to next screen

### **Screen 4: Crisis Resources** 🆘

## Key Design Principles

### **Privacy & Control** 🔒
- Employee chooses if they want help
- Employee selects who can contact them
- Employee chooses communication method (including anonymous)
- Employee sets preferred timeframe
- Individual responses never linked to person

### **Immediate Access** ⚡
- Crisis resources shown immediately
- No waiting, no barriers
- Professional support available 24/7
- Multiple pathways (internal + external)

### **Respectful & Non-Judgmental** 💚
- No pressure to accept help
- Can skip any step
- Can request support but remain anonymous
- Language is supportive, not clinical

### **Low Barrier** 📱
- Mobile-optimised
- No login required
- Visual, easy to understand
- Takes 2-3 minutes if support requested

1. "They answer honestly - the system respects that"
2. "If struggling is detected, a supportive offer appears - no judgment"

5. "Meanwhile, crisis resources are right there - immediate help"

### **Key Benefits (1 minute)**
