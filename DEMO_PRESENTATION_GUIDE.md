- If they think it's a mental health assessment → clarify it's about organisational conditions
- If they say "we already do surveys" → explain weekly vs annual difference
- If they worry about privacy → show anonymity guarantees
- If they worry about survey fatigue → explain 60 seconds, simple, mobile-friendly
