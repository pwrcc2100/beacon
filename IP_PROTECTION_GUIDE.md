## Protection Strategies

### 1. Copyright Protection (Automatic in Australia)

- Written content (survey questions, documentation)
- Software code (platform, dashboards)
- Visual designs (UI, graphics, layouts)
- Documentation and methodologies

**Action Required:**
- ✅ Already protected automatically upon creation
- Add copyright notices: `© 2025 Beacon Effect. All rights reserved.`
- Keep dated records of creation (Git commits, file timestamps)

**Where to Add Notices:**
- Website footer (already done)
- All documentation
- Software code headers
- Client-facing materials

---

### 2. Trade Secrets (Most Important for You)

**What Qualifies:**
- Survey questions and exact wording
- Branching logic and algorithms
- Scoring formulas and weightings
- Proprietary methodologies
- Client data and insights

**Protection Actions:**

#### Immediate (Do Now):
- [x] Create client-facing overview (done - `WELLBEING_SURVEY_OVERVIEW.md`)
- [ ] Add confidentiality clauses to all service agreements
- [ ] Create Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) for prospects
- [ ] Mark sensitive documents as "Confidential"
- [ ] Limit access to detailed survey questions/algorithms

#### Ongoing:
- Only share detailed IP under signed NDA
- Use client overview documents for sales/marketing
- Keep detailed methodology in secure locations
- Track who has access to sensitive information
- Regular audits of what's publicly accessible

---

### 3. Trademarks

**Consider Registering:**
- "Beacon Effect" (business name)
- "Beacon Wellbeing" (product name)
- "Beacon Advisory" (service name)
- Logo/brand marks

**Benefits:**
- Exclusive rights to use names
- Prevents competitors from using similar names
- Adds value to business
- Easier to enforce

**Process:**
1. Search existing trademarks: https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/
2. File application with IP Australia
3. Cost: ~$250-$400 per class
4. Takes 6-12 months

**Recommendation:** Register "Beacon Effect" and "Beacon Wellbeing" at minimum.

---

### 4. Patents (Probably Not Necessary)

**When Needed:**
- Novel technical inventions
- Unique algorithms or processes

**For Beacon:**
- Probably not required (survey methodology is trade secret, not patentable)
- Very expensive ($10,000-$30,000+)
- Only consider if you have truly novel technical innovation

**Recommendation:** Focus on trade secrets and copyright instead.
