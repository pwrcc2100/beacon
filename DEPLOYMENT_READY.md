3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** = OFF (to rebuild with new env vars)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Set NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_CLIENT_ID"
- **Solution**: Make sure you redeployed after adding environment variables
- Variables don't apply to existing deployments - need to redeploy

### Dashboard is Empty
- **Solution**: Click "Generate 100 Demo Records" button
- Or use API: POST to `/api/demo/seed-with-departments`

### Can't Access Dashboard
- **Check**: Is `ADMIN_DASH_TOKEN` set? If yes, you need to login
- **Check**: Database connection (Supabase credentials)

### Build Errors
- Check Vercel deployment logs: https://vercel.com/beacon1/beacon/deployments
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
