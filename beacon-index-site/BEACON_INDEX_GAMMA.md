## Why These 5 Questions Matter

Evidence-based domains that signal emerging psychosocial risk

### 1. Workload & Pressure

Detects spikes in job demand and resourcing pressure before they impact safety or delivery.

### 2. Support & Communication

Reveals whether teams feel backed by leaders and can raise issues without barriers.

### 3. Clarity & Planning

Identifies breakdowns in planning, sequencing, and role clarity that create rework.

### 4. Team Climate & Respect

Captures cues of psychological safety, respect, and interpersonal trust across teams.

### 5. General Wellbeing / Sentiment

Quickly signals how people feel about work this week, highlighting recovery or decline.

## How the Beacon Index is Created

Beacon transforms raw weekly sentiment into a high-fidelity signal that leaders can trust. Every step protects anonymity, ensures integrity, and delivers timely insight.

1. **Raw Responses** - Captured weekly via SMS and secure web links
2. **Cleaned & De-identified** - Validated against anonymity thresholds
3. **Weighted Scoring** - Applied across the five domains to produce a signal-sensitive index
4. **Trend Analysis** - Powers dashboards that highlight movement, hotspots, and outliers
5. **Beacon Index (0-100%)** - For every team and the overall organisation

## Feedback Loop to Leaders

Leaders receive clear insights on hotspots, comments, trends, and week-on-week movement. Early detection means action is targeted, timely, and compassionate—centred on conditions, not individuals.

### What Leaders Learn

- Which teams are under pressure or stabilising
- Where communication or support is breaking down
- Whether planning, sequencing, or clarity are causing friction
- Patterns of recovery or decline week-to-week
- If actions, initiatives, or interventions are working
- How psychosocial risk is trending across sites and divisions

---
