## ðŸš€ How It Works Now

### Automatic Deployments

1. **Push to GitHub** â†’ Vercel automatically deploys
2. **Pull Requests** â†’ Get preview deployments
3. **Production branch** (usually `main`) â†’ Deploys to production URL

### Workflow

```bash
# Make changes to your code
# Commit and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push

# Vercel automatically:
# - Detects the push
# - Builds your project
# - Deploys to production
```
