# ✅ Fixed: Demo Data Generator Authorization

## Problem Fixed
The "Generate 100 Demo Records" button was returning `{"error":"unauthorized"}` because the API wasn't checking cookies.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Updated API Routes** to check for authentication cookie:
- `/api/demo/seed` - Now checks `dash` cookie
- `/api/demo/seed-with-departments` - Now checks `dash` cookie

✅ **Created Client Component** (`GenerateDemoDataButton.tsx`):
- Uses fetch with `credentials: 'same-origin'`
- Automatically includes cookies
- Shows loading state and success/error messages
- Refreshes page after successful generation

## How It Works Now

1. **You log into dashboard** → Cookie is set (`dash` cookie)
2. **Click "Generate 100 Demo Records"** → Button uses client-side fetch
3. **Fetch includes cookies** → API checks cookie for authentication
4. **Demo data generated** → Success message shown, page refreshes

## ✅ Fixed and Redeployed!

**New Deployment**: https://beacon-61v81fmre-beacon1.vercel.app

The fix has been deployed. The button should now work when you:
1. Are logged into the dashboard (have the `dash` cookie)
2. Click "Generate 100 Demo Records"

## Testing

After the new deployment completes:
1. Visit: https://beacon-61v81fmre-beacon1.vercel.app/dashboard
2. Login with your admin token (if required)
3. Click "Generate 100 Demo Records"
4. Should work without errors! ✅
