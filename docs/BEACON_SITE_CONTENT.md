- Say “senior advisory” (not “consulting”).  
- Highlight “digital initiatives” rather than synonyms.  
- Construction/safety experience is background only; not a current service line.

## Additional Notes / TODOs

- **Email/domain consistency:** Several wellbeing pages and admin quick links still reference `hello@beaconwellbeing.com.au` and `www.beaconwellbeing.com.au`. Update to `hello@beaconeffect.com.au` + new public domain when confirmed.
- **Navigation links:** Check whether `/features` and `/pricing` should point to `/wellbeing/features` and `/wellbeing/pricing` for clarity, or retain legacy routes intentionally.
- **Content duplication:** `/wellbeing/about` and `/about` share large sections; decide on canonical page to maintain.
- **One-pager print block:** update branding lines once final domain/email locked.
- **SEO/meta:** still pending (per cleanup checklist) – add meta descriptions & OG tags before launch.

Feel free to mark edits or comments directly in this file. Once the copy is final, I’ll sync the updates back into the corresponding React pages.
