# QR Code Component Visibility Fix

## Issue
QR code component not visible on dashboard page even after deployment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Component in Two Locations
- **Inside `print:hidden` section** (line 729-733): Added with bright yellow debug box
- **Outside `print:hidden` section** (line 737-740): Added as backup with bright yellow debug box

### 2. Added Explicit Visibility Styles
```tsx
style={{ display: 'block', visibility: 'visible', opacity: 1, zIndex: 9999 }}
```

### 3. Added Debug Markers
- Bright yellow background (`bg-yellow-200`)
- Red border (`border-4 border-red-500`)
- Debug text in red: "üîç DEBUG: QR Code Component Should Be Below This Line"
- Backup location: "üîç BACKUP: QR Code Should Also Be Here (Outside print:hidden)"

## Testing Steps

After deployment completes (check Vercel status):
1. **Hard refresh** the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Look for **bright yellow boxes with red borders**
3. If you see the yellow boxes but NOT the QR code component:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Component may have a rendering error

## If Still Not Visible

### Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors related to:
   - `DemoQRCode`
   - `clientId`
   - React hydration errors

### Check Network Tab
1. In DevTools, go to Network tab
2. Refresh page
3. Look for:
   - Failed requests to `/api/surveys/issue`
   - Missing chunk files

### Check Vercel Build Logs
```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url> --logs
```

### Previous Fix Pattern
If similar issues occurred before:
- Usually related to **client-side component hydration**
- May need to ensure component is properly marked as `'use client'`
- Check if there's a build cache issue (`.next` folder)

## Next Steps if Debug Boxes Appear But QR Code Doesn't

1. Check if `clientId` is being passed correctly
2. Verify the component imports correctly
3. Check browser console for React errors
4. Try accessing the component directly: `/components/dashboard/DemoQRCode`
