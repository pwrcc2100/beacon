## ⚠️ Important: Add Environment Variables

Your dashboard won't work fully until you add environment variables to Vercel.

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/beacon1/beacon/settings/environment-variables

**Add these**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://beacon-5tffcd7v0-beacon1.vercel.app`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_CLIENT_ID`
- `ADMIN_DASH_TOKEN`

Then **Redeploy** from the Vercel dashboard.
