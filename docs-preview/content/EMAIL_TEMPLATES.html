<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Early detection for workplace wellbeing
risks</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Hi [First Name],</p>
<p>I noticed [Company Name] has been growing rapidly—congratulations!
With that growth often comes hidden challenges around team wellbeing and
psychosocial safety.</p>
<p>I wanted to share <strong>Beacon</strong>, a platform we’ve built
specifically for organisations like yours that want to stay ahead of
workplace stress issues before they become crises.</p>
<p>Unlike annual engagement surveys that tell you what went wrong last
year, Beacon provides: - <strong>Weekly 60-second pulse checks</strong>
on team wellbeing - <strong>Real-time dashboards</strong> showing which
teams need support - <strong>Early warning system</strong> for burnout
and disengagement - <strong>Anonymous responses</strong> to encourage
honesty</p>
<p>We’re already working with [similar company/industry] organisations
and seeing impressive results—10-15% reduction in turnover within the
first year.</p>
<p>Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if Beacon could
help [Company Name]? I can show you the dashboard and walk through how
it works.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://calendly.com/beacon/demo">Book a
time</a></strong> that suits you, or just reply to this email.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Hi [First Name],</p>
<p>Following up on my email last week about Beacon.</p>
<p>I know you’re busy, so I’ll keep this brief:</p>
<p><strong>3 reasons why HR leaders are switching to
Beacon:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Early detection</strong> — Spot team issues within weeks,
not years</li>
<li><strong>Real-time data</strong> — Make decisions based on what’s
happening now</li>
<li><strong>Compliance made easy</strong> — Meet your psychosocial
safety obligations effortlessly</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re offering a <strong>free 2-week trial</strong> for up to 50
employees—no credit card, no obligation. Just a chance to see if Beacon
would be valuable for [Company Name].</p>
<p>Would you like to give it a try?</p>
<p>Best regards, [Your Name] Beacon Wellbeing Platform</p>

<p>Hi team,</p>
<p>We’re launching a new initiative to help us better support your
wellbeing at work.</p>
<p><strong>Starting this week</strong>, you’ll receive a short survey

around your role - Psychological safety</p>
<p><strong>Why we’re doing this:</strong> We want to spot challenges
early and address them before they become bigger issues. This isn’t
about surveillance—it’s about support.</p>
<p><strong>Your privacy is guaranteed:</strong> - Responses are
completely anonymous - Leadership only sees aggregated team data
(minimum 5 responses) - No individual responses are ever shared - You
can skip any question you’re uncomfortable answering</p>
<p><strong>What happens with the data:</strong> Your leadership team
will use these insights to: - Identify where teams need more support -
Make better decisions about workload and resources - Improve workplace
culture and psychological safety</p>
<p><strong>Your first survey arrives [Day/Date].</strong></p>
