# Beacon: Email Templates for Client Outreach

## 1. Initial Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** Early detection for workplace wellbeing risks

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] has been growing rapidlyâ€”congratulations! With that growth often comes hidden challenges around team wellbeing and psychosocial safety.

I wanted to share **Beacon**, a platform we've built specifically for organisations like yours that want to stay ahead of workplace stress issues before they become crises.

Unlike annual engagement surveys that tell you what went wrong last year, Beacon provides:
- **Weekly 60-second pulse checks** on team wellbeing
- **Real-time dashboards** showing which teams need support
- **Early warning system** for burnout and disengagement
- **Anonymous responses** to encourage honesty

We're already working with [similar company/industry] organisations and seeing impressive resultsâ€”10-15% reduction in turnover within the first year.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if Beacon could help [Company Name]? I can show you the dashboard and walk through how it works.

**[Book a time](https://calendly.com/beacon/demo)** that suits you, or just reply to this email.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## 2. Follow-Up Email (7 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Early detection for workplace wellbeing risks

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email last week about Beacon.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**3 reasons why HR leaders are switching to Beacon:**

1. **Early detection** â€” Spot team issues within weeks, not years
2. **Real-time data** â€” Make decisions based on what's happening now
3. **Compliance made easy** â€” Meet your psychosocial safety obligations effortlessly

We're offering a **free 2-week trial** for up to 50 employeesâ€”no credit card, no obligation. Just a chance to see if Beacon would be valuable for [Company Name].

Would you like to give it a try?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
