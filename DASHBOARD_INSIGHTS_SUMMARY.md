## Key Metrics Displayed

### 1. Overall Wellbeing Score

**What It Measures:**  
A weighted composite of five evidence-based dimensions, providing a single metric for organisational health.

**Weighting Formula:**

- 🔴 **Red (0-49):** Immediate action required

---

### 2. Sentiment / Overall Mood (25% weighting)

**What We Ask:**  
"How are you feeling about work this week?"

**What It Reveals:**

"Is your current workload sustainable?"

**What It Reveals:**
- Risk of burnout
- Resource allocation issues
- Capacity planning needs

**Dashboard Display:**
- Percentage reporting unsustainable workload
- Trend over time
- Comparison across departments (identifies hotspots)

**Action Triggers:**
- >30% reporting unsustainable workload = immediate review required

---

### 4. Psychological Safety (20% weighting)

**What We Ask:**  
"Do you feel safe speaking up about concerns or problems?"

**What It Reveals:**
- Culture of openness and trust
- Risk of hidden problems
- Innovation capacity

**Dashboard Display:**
- Percentage feeling safe vs. unsafe
- Trend analysis
- Team-level comparison

**Why It's Critical:**  
Research shows psychological safety is the #1 predictor of high-performing teams (Google's Project Aristotle).

---

### 5. Leadership Support (20% weighting)

**What We Ask:**  
"Do you feel supported by your manager/leadership?"

**What It Reveals:**
- Management effectiveness
- Retention risk
- Team morale

**Dashboard Display:**
- Support score by department/division
- Identifies specific leadership gaps
- Correlation with turnover data

**Action Triggers:**
- Low scores in specific teams = targeted leadership coaching
- Declining trend = review management practices

---

### 6. Clarity / Direction (10% weighting)

**What We Ask:**  
"Do you have clarity about your role and what's expected?"

**What It Reveals:**
- Communication effectiveness
- Role ambiguity
- Organisational alignment

**Dashboard Display:**
- Clarity score over time
- Comparison across teams
- Correlation with performance metrics

---

## Advanced Analytics

### Distribution Histograms

Instead of showing only averages, the dashboard displays **how responses are distributed**:

- Identifies polarisation (some very happy, some very unhappy)
- Reveals whether issues are widespread or isolated
- Shows whether interventions are moving the needle

**Example Insight:**  
"Average score is 65 (amber), but histogram shows 40% of team in red zone—targeted intervention needed for at-risk group."

---

### Correlation Heat Map

Visual matrix showing relationships between dimensions:

- **High correlation between Workload and Mood** → Capacity issue driving dissatisfaction
- **Low correlation between Support and Clarity** → Independent issues requiring different interventions

**Why It Matters:**  
Identifies root causes rather than symptoms, enabling more effective interventions.

---

### Individual Journey Tracking

Anonymised longitudinal view showing how individuals' scores change over time:

- Identifies patterns (e.g., gradual decline vs. sudden drop)
- Measures intervention effectiveness
- Highlights at-risk individuals for proactive support

**Privacy Protection:**  
Individual data is anonymised and only shown in aggregate when team size is >5 people.

---

### Response Rate Tracking

Monitors participation over time:

- Identifies survey fatigue
- Highlights teams with low engagement
- Ensures data is representative

**Benchmark:**  
Beacon surveys typically achieve 70-85% response rates (vs. 30-40% for traditional annual surveys).

---

### Statistical Process Control (SPC) Charts

Goes beyond simple trend lines to show:

- **Upper and Lower Control Limits** - Natural variation vs. significant change
- **Trend Signals** - 7+ consecutive points in one direction = systemic shift
- **Outliers** - Scores outside control limits = investigate immediately

**Why It Matters:**  
Distinguishes between normal fluctuation and meaningful change, preventing over-reaction to noise.

---

## Organisational Drill-Down

### Hierarchical View

Navigate from whole-of-business down to team level:

1. **Enterprise View** - Overall organisational health
2. **Division View** - Compare divisions (e.g., Operations vs. Corporate)
3. **Department View** - Identify specific problem areas
4. **Team View** - Pinpoint teams requiring support

**Minimum Team Size:**  
Results only shown when team size is ≥5 to protect anonymity.

---

### Comparative Analysis

**"Which Teams Need Attention?"**

Bar chart ranking teams by wellbeing score:
- Quickly identifies outliers (high and low)
- Enables peer learning (what are high-performing teams doing differently?)
- Prioritises leadership attention

**Example Use Case:**  
"Team A has consistently high scores—interview their manager to identify best practices. Team B shows declining trend—schedule 1:1 with team lead."

---

## Executive Summary Widget

**AI-Generated Insights**

The dashboard includes a natural-language summary highlighting:

- **Key Risks:** "Workload scores in Engineering have declined 15% over 4 weeks—burnout risk"
- **Positive Trends:** "Psychological Safety scores up 12% following leadership training"
- **Comparative Insights:** "Sales team reports 20% higher support scores than company average"
- **Action Recommendations:** "Consider workload review for Project Delivery team"

**Why It Matters:**  
Busy executives get the story behind the numbers without manual analysis.
